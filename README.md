# sturdy-waffle
A vampire town builder where you keep on moving around the world avoiding the sun.
Collect resources, create new vampires and work towards a project to block out the sun.

How to run:
Change directory to the unzipped Sturdy-Waffle file. Run the command 'python ./src/main.py'

Running main.py directly file from within the src folder may cause the image files to not be found, due to conflicts with the different ways Linux and Windows handle paths.

How to play:

Press left, right or a and d keys to scroll. 
Left click to select units on the map, or buildings from the menu.
Right click to move a unit to a location, or place a unit in a building.
Right click to place buildings selected from the menu, and to empty occupied buildings.
You can move vampires into buildings to produce resources. Move vampires intohouses to produce more vampires. 
BEWARE: vampires die in sunlight, even whilst in buildings.

Vampires can be sacrificed in the pyramid building. Once 10 vampires have been sacrificed the sun will be blocked out and you win the game.
If all your vampires die before this point you lose the game. You can see your progress towards winning in the red bar at the top of the screen.

Your population cap is determined by the amount of blood you have. 1 blood is 1 population.
